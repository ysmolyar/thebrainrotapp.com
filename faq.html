                    <p>Screen time data relies on Apple's Screen Time system, which can sometimes have delays. Certain calculations, like brain health, rely on estimated screen time which can deviate from actual screen time. We strive for high accuracy but cannot guarantee 100% accuracy due to system limitations.</p>
